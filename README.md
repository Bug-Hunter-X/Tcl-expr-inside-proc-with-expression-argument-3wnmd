This repository contains a Tcl script demonstrating an unexpected behavior when using the "expr" command inside a procedure with an argument that is itself an expression.  The script shows the error and provides a solution. The problem arises because the procedure tries to evaluate the argument as a numerical expression before using it in the expr command, leading to unexpected results.
